# Perceptual Sensitivity to Rotational Differences in Natural Images

This repository contains the code and data analyses for the paper **"Perceptual Sensitivity to Rotational Differences in Natural Images"**. The study investigates how humans perceive and discriminate angular differences in natural images using psychophysical experiments and perceptual scaling methods (MLDS).

## Overview

The project includes:

- Analysis of psychometric response curves derived from human judgments of rotated images.
- Computation of perceptual scales and their relation to internal noise (Ïƒ).
- Comparison between rotation and Gaussian noise using RMSE as a common physical distortion metric.
- Reaction time modeling using multiple distribution fits (Normal, Ex-Gaussian, Skew Normal, Log-Normal, etc.).
- Visualization tools for generating all plots included in the paper.
