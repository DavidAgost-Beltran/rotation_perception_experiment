# Perceptual Sensitivity to Rotational Differences in Natural Images

This repository contains the code and data analyses for the paper **"Perceptual Sensitivity to Rotational Differences in Natural Images"**. The study investigates how humans perceive and discriminate angular differences in natural images using psychophysical experiments and perceptual scaling methods (MLDS).

You can execute the Jupyter notebooks to reproduce the figures shown in the paper, including reaction time distributions, psychometric bias curves, and MLDS perceptual scales for selected images.

## Overview

The project includes:

-Plot of MLDS perceptual scales.

-Fitting linear functions to the mean MLDS response curves.

-Analysis of psychometric response curves derived from human judgments of rotated images.

-Reaction time modeling using multiple distribution fits (Normal, Ex-Gaussian, Skew Normal, Log-Normal, etc.).

-Analysis of the relationship between reaction time and task difficulty.




## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

- `mlds_rotation_results.csv`: MLDS results for rotational distortions using Maloneyâ€™s R package.
- `mlds_gaussian_results.csv`: MLDS results for Gaussian noise distortions using Maloneyâ€™s R package.
